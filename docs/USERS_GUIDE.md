# User's Guide

## Getting Started

GPX Manager helps you organize your travel data in one place. The app has two main libraries: one for trip files and one for saved locations. Open the app and you will see the main menu.

## Main Menu

The main menu offers three options:

- **Trip Library** -- Manage your GPX route files and PDF travel documents.
- **Locations** -- Save and organize places you want to remember.
- **Settings** -- App settings (coming soon).

## Trip Library

The Trip Library stores your GPX and PDF files in a folder structure that you define.

### Browsing

When you open the Trip Library, you see the contents of the top-level folder. Folders are shown at the top, followed by your GPX and PDF files displayed as cards.

- Tap a **folder** to open it.
- Use the **back arrow** at the top to go up one level.

### GPX File Cards

Each GPX file card shows:
- File name
- Date recorded
- Number of routes, tracks, and waypoints
- Total path length in kilometers

### PDF File Cards

Each PDF file card shows:
- File name
- Upload date
- Number of pages

### Adding Content

Tap the **+** button in the bottom-right corner to:
- **New Folder** -- Create a folder to organize your files.
- **Upload GPX** -- Select a GPX file from your device to import.
- **Upload PDF** -- Select a PDF file from your device to import.

Imported files are stored within the app. The original file on your device is not modified.

### Managing Files and Folders

Long-press any file or folder to access these actions:
- **Rename** -- Change the display name.
- **Move** -- Move the item to a different folder.
- **Copy** -- Create a duplicate in another folder.
- **Delete** -- Permanently remove the item. Deleting a folder also removes its contents.
- **Download** (files only) -- Save a copy to a location of your choice on your device.

## Location Library

The Location Library lets you save and categorize places.

### Browsing

The Location Library works the same way as the Trip Library. Folders appear at the top, and location cards are shown below.

Each location card shows:
- Location name
- Address

### Adding Content

Tap the **+** button to:
- **New Folder** -- Create a folder for organizing locations.
- **New Location** -- Create a new location entry.

### Editing a Location

Tap a location card to open it. You can edit:
- **Name** -- A descriptive name for the place.
- **Address** -- The street address or description.
- **Category** -- Select from existing categories or tap **New** to create one.
- **Coordinates** -- Longitude and latitude values.

Changes are saved automatically as you type.

### Managing Locations and Folders

Long-press any location or folder for the same actions available in the Trip Library: rename, move, copy, and delete.
